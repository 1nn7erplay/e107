   chown -R xxx:xxx public_html

## Reporting Bugs

Be sure you are using the most recent version of e107 prior to reporting an issue.
You may report any bugs and make feature requests [e107's GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/e107inc/e107/issues).



## Contributing to Development

* Please submit 1 pull request for each GitHub issue you work on. 
* Make sure that only the lines you have changed actually show up in a file-comparison (diff).
  Some text editors alter every line; this should be avoided. 
* It is recommended to configure `git pull` to rebase on the master branch by default to avoid unnecessary merge commits.  You can set this up in your copy of the repo's `.git/config` file like so:
  ```
  [branch "master"]
    rebase = true
  ``` 
* See the [CONTRIBUTING](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) document for a tutorial on getting started.
